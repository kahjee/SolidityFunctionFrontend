# SolidityFunctionFrontend

## Description

This Solidity code is a contract sample created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the ETH + AVAX Intermediate course of Metacrafters. The purpose of the code is to showcase the skills that were taught from the aformentioned course, mainly developing functions in Solidity, among other concepts.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension. Copy and paste the code from main.sol from this GitHub page into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile (name of file).sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "(name of file)" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
